User Management Project

We did an application to manage users in a database. The application is multi-lingual (English, French, Spanish) and uses a webmail contact form. The application allows anyone to manage users easily by, through forms, adding users, displaying them, deleting them or modifying them. With regular expressions, you can find an user by writing just the beginning of an username.
